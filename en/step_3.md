## The Teaching Approach trial

It is important to note that, while the research suggests that this teaching approach may be particularly beneficial for girls, we expect that a wide range of pupils will benefit. When we talk about boys’ and girls’ attitudes to computing throughout this course, we are basing the discussion on research which has suggested differences on average between them. We recognise that this does not necessarily reflect all pupils’ experiences of computing.

In the Teaching Approach trial, we are asking two key questions. Does linking computing lessons to storytelling in Key Stage 1:
+ make computing more accessible to a range of pupils?
+ improve girls’ perception of computing?
